# LDJAM47

This project was created for the Ludum Dare 47 Videogame Jam.

It is an unfinished project which I did during the weekend the jam took place.

It is a 3rd Person Shooter, in which we'll have to survive the zombie hordes while discovering the whole
map by gifting the souls of the undead to unlock the different doors and gates.

I focused mainly on game feel and game systems architecture.
